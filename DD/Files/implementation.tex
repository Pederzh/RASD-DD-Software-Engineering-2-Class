SafeStreets is composed by these subsystems:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 
	Web App for end user
	\item 
	Web App for authorities
	\item 
	Application back-end
	\item 
	Report provider for authorities
\end{itemize}
Furthermore, the system works with external services such as:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 
	Google Maps 
	\item 
	CUU authenticator
	\item 
	DBMS
\end{itemize}

Each subsystem will be implemented and tested indipendently with a top down approach. At the end of this phase a test of the whole system will check the integration between the components. 

The external compontes will be used directly without any kind of test because they are assumed to be reliable.
