\subsection{External Interface Requirements}
\subsubsection{Software interfaces}
The system fuctionalities are provided without using third part application.
The external API are exposed only for authorities application and the implentation details will be shown in the design document.

\subsection{Design constraints}
\subsubsection{Standards compliance}
Part of the information collected by Safestreet (ex: license plate) are sensitive. For this reason the project is subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). One of the technique used by the system to protect these important information is the creation of different type of user. For example normal account can only send information while authorities have a different account that is able to access to the data colleceted and generated.

\subsubsection{Hardware limitations}
The application is based on retrieving data from the photos sent by the user. Obviously the camera of the devices is a crucial aspect to consider during the design process. For this reason a minimun resolution of the sensor is required to install the application.The identification of this value will be done during design phase and will be written in the design document.
An other constraint is generated by the precision of the gps sensor of the device. Since the impact is smaller than the image resolution, the requirement is not so strict. 

\subsubsection{Any other constraint}
Safestreet works with violations and traffic tickets so it has to deal with law and regulation implications.
For this aspect see the specific domain assumption. 
Furthermore we have to consider the possible improper use of the platform. To prevent it Safestreet do some specific control on the images and is able to detect editing or repeated photos of the same violations. The implementation of this part will be done with some external algorithm and will be detailed in the design document.
