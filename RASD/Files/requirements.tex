\subsection{External Interface Requirements}
\subsubsection{Software interfaces}
The system fuctionalities are provided without using third part application.
The external API are exposed only for authorities application and the implentation details will be shown in the design document.

\subsection{Design constraints}
\subsubsection{Standards compliance}
Part of the information collected by Safestreet (ex: license plate) are sensitive. For this reason the project is subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). One of the technique used by the system to protect these important information is the creation of different type of user. For example normal account can only send information while authorities have a different account that is able to access to the data colleceted and generated.

\subsubsection{Hardware limitations}
The application is based on retrieving data from the photos sent by the user. Obviously the camera of the devices is a crucial aspect to consider during the design process. For this reason a minimun resolution of the sensor is required to install the application.The identification of this value will be done during design phase and will be written in the design document.
An other constraint is generated by the precision of the gps sensor of the device. Since the impact is smaller than the image resolution, the requirement is not so strict. 

\subsubsection{Any other constraint}
Safestreet works with violations and traffic tickets so it has to deal with law and regulation implications.
For this aspect see the specific domain assumption. 
Furthermore we have to consider the possible improper use of the platform. To prevent it Safestreet do some specific control on the images and is able to detect editing or repeated photos of the same violations. The implementation of this part will be done with some external algorithm and will be detailed in the design document.

\subsection{Functional requirements}
\subsubsection{Definition of use case diagram}
The use case diagrams provide a vision of the uses that can be done with the platform. They show the relationship between the actors and the use that every actor made with the software to reach the goals.

\subsubsection{Scenario 1}
Paul wants to sign up to SafeStreet platform. He has to insert his personal data (name, surname,place,mail etc.) and optionally also the car license plate. He will recieve a confirm mail and can use the platform.
\subsubsection{Scenario 2}
Bob is coming back to his car when he notice that someone has parked in double row and he canâ€™t move. He log in into the safestreet app and he take a picture of the car to report it to the platform which analize the reporting and, in case it is true,it  could generate a traffic ticket and store the data to generate statistics.

\subsubsection{Scenario 3}
Luke is walking on the sidewalk when he see that a young guy is parking on a park reserved for disable.
Luke take a picture of the car and report it to the safestreet platform which analize the reporting and in case it could generate a traffic ticket and store the data to generate statistics.

\subsubsection{Scenario 4}
Mark has submitted a report to the safestreet platform, and he want to check if it has been accepted or declined.
He logs in into the app, he accesses to his reserved area and next to his report there is the status of message sent.

\subsubsection{Scenario 5}
Bill wants to check if someone has made a report on his car. He logs in into the platform and get the access to his profile where he can check if there is any traffic ticket for his car.

\subsubsection{Scenario 6}
The local authority wants to check which are the streets with more reports. They log in into the platform and access to their personal area where they can check the street status. They can set the color of the street based on the reports they recieve but also the platform automatically change the color of the streets based on the reports that recieve through the app.

 
\subsubsection{Scenario 7}
The local authority wants to check which are the vehicle with more reports. They log in into the platform and access to their personal area where they can check the cars that have the most reports assigned. They can set the color of the cars based on the reports they recieve but also the platform automatically change the color of the cars based on the reports that recieve through the app.

\subsubsection{Scenario 8}
The system recieves the photos from the users and have to check if they are true or fake. It runs an alghoritm that can detect if the photo is real or it has been modified. In the first case, the report will be stored and can be generate a traffic ticket. In the second case the report will be discarded.

\subsubsection{Scenario 9}
The local authority have to relase a traffic ticket in case of a user made an infringement. The platform auto-generate the trafic tickets when a report result real, and the local authority recieve a notify.
