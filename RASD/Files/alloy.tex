During the draft of the alloy, we omitted the aspects regarding the chain of custody because, as mentioned in Security description (3.7.3), these controls are made before storing information in the system, thus the other portions of the application are able to ignore it.

For this reason there is no constraint in Alloy that checks the fact that the report and the image can only exist if the information are genuine.
